# Why cats could be liquid (STA426_REPO_LM)
## Goal of this REPO:
This repo has two important functions:

**1.** -To do the first exercise of the week

**2.** To give some hints if **cats are liquid**

## Hypothesis: Cats are liquid

### Empirical Proofs
![First indication](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-11/25/22/asset/8762be2aa707/sub-buzz-258-1574721738-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto)
![Second indication](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-11/25/22/asset/c7101153bb54/sub-buzz-80-1574720061-11.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto) 

### More scientific Proofs
Fardin showed in a publication called [On the rheology of cats](https://www.drgoulu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Rheology-of-cats.pdf) in 2014 some indication which could confirm the hypothesis.
This was so convincing that **he even won a _Nobel_ prize** (very precisely the IG-Nobel prize but this is a small detail)
